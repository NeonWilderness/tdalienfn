# Alien inside Twoday
"Alien Inside Twoday" is a special layout (zip file), that allows [Twoday](https://twoday.net) blogger to embed their new (external) blog within their old/former Twoday blog site in a synced way.

This "serverless" [Netlify function](https://www.netlify.com/products/functions/) provides a JSON parsed/transformed RSS from an external blog feed (e.g. Wordpress, Tumblr, Blogger...) to enable story/article sychronization with Twoday.
